uDeltaPlugin_for_Repetier_Host
==============================

This is the sources of the µDelta Plugin we give to our customer.

It was originaly just a prototype in order to see if it works or not
but under the constraint of time we transformed it into a public version.
So sadly it is still a demo version, and really really rough and hardcoded!!
The prototype was coded really quickly (with the time we have...) and I couldn't spend more time until now...
Please be carefull with your eyes, you may bleed.

I may add some features and code clarification soon:
- Add some more comments
- refactoring everything, make it clear
- Add some configuration file for a general Delta purpose (and not just the µDelta)
- internationalization
- Some more expert mode features (as special auto-configuration, or serial-number based auto-update)


@Repetier: if you read this, thanks for your great work!! 
Plugin possibility is really really cool for any user! Please keep your host free!
